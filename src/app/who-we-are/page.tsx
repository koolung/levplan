            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I never set out to become a financial planner. My path was indirect, more human than that.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              It started with Internet Technology—back in 1997, when "getting online" meant the sound of a dial-up modem and genuine patience. I was the person on the other end of the phone helping people connect to the internet for the first time, troubleshooting their frustrations, teaching them something completely foreign. Even then, I was translating complexity into clarity.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But I wanted more. I wanted to see the world, to test myself, to find out who I really was beyond the comfortable borders of New Brunswick.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              In 2002, I moved to South Korea to teach English. For four years, I taught everyone from kindergarteners learning their first English words to adults refining their conversational skills. I lived in a culture completely different from my own, learned to navigate uncertainty, and met my wife—a connection that would shape the rest of my life.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              South Korea gave me something I'd never had before: enormous confidence and belief in my abilities. I became a better person. I discovered I could do hard things, adapt to anything, and connect with people from all walks of life.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              When I returned home—married, transformed, hungry to build something meaningful—I knew I wanted to create a business with unlimited potential to help people.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              A financial planning opportunity fell into my lap, and I seized it. For 13 years, I worked with a large planning firm, earning my credentials as a Registered Retirement Consultant (RRC) and Registered Financial and Retirement Advisor (RFRA).
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I learned the technical craft: tax strategies, pension optimization, investment management and estate planning.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But I also learned what was broken. I watched clients pay too much in fees. I saw cookie-cutter plans that didn't fit real lives. I noticed families facing hardship because of improper risk management—consequences that could have been prevented.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              After 13 years, I reached a turning point: I needed to create a firm with my values and beliefs, not someone else's.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#031931] mt-12 mb-6">In 2019, I founded LevPlan.</h2>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Three things mattered most to me:
            </p>

            <ul className="space-y-4 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
              <li className="text-lg">Controlling client costs so you don't pay more than necessary</li>
              <li className="text-lg">Creating substantially better outcomes with strategies optimized for your unique situation</li>
              <li className="text-lg">Delivering an amazing client experience where you work with a team that is accountable, available, and transparent</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I work directly with clients across Canada. When you call, you get a human. When you have a question, I answer it—quickly.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I'm a musician. I still compose and play, and I've come to see retirement planning the same way I see a song: it has an introduction, a bridge, a crescendo, and an ending. Your introduction is where you are now. The bridge is the transition from working years to retirement freedom. The crescendo is your peak retirement years—the travel, the time with grandchildren, the life you've earned. And the ending is your legacy, managed with intention and care.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Every element has to work in harmony. Miss one note—a poorly timed RRSP withdrawal, an ignored OAS clawback, inadequate insurance—and the whole composition suffers.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#031931] mt-10 mb-6">Two things keep me up at night.</h3>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Missed opportunities.</strong> When I see someone leave $50,000 in tax savings on the table simply because no one showed them a better way, it breaks my heart.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>And families facing hardship from poor risk management.</strong> A breadwinner without proper insurance. A retiree who didn't plan for long-term care. These aren't abstract problems—they're real people I could have helped.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I don't want you to look back at 70 and realize you could have retired five years earlier, traveled more, or left more for your children—if only someone had shown you how.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Now, married for 22 years with two boys, eating with chopsticks every day (when you marry a Korean lady, that's very normal), mountain biking through New Brunswick trails, and still composing music in my home studio, I live the life I once thought was impossible.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I tell you this because retirement planning isn't just about money. It's about believing you deserve the life you want and having the courage to build it.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#031931] mt-10 mb-6">My Ideal Client</h3>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              My ideal clients are people aged 30-60 who have excellent saving habits and are open to working with an advisor to optimize their situation. You're already doing the right things—saving consistently, thinking ahead, being responsible. You don't need someone to scold you or start from scratch. You need someone to take what you're already doing and make it work exponentially harder for you.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You want expert advice and a real relationship. You value transparency and you're willing to be open and honest about your finances, your goals, and your fears. And ideally, you're fun to talk to. This is your future we're designing—it should be engaging, even exciting.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#031931] mt-10 mb-6">My Promise to You</h3>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              When you work with me, I promise:
            </p>

            <ul className="space-y-4 mb-6 list-disc list-inside">
              <li className="text-lg"><strong>Accountability</strong>—I do what I say I'll do</li>
              <li className="text-lg"><strong>Availability</strong>—you're not a file number, and I'm here for quick consults and fast service</li>
              <li className="text-lg"><strong>Transparency</strong>—no jargon designed to confuse you, no hidden fees, no strategies I can't explain in plain English</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              In return, I hope you'll be open and honest with me. The best plans come from real conversations about what matters most to you—not just what the spreadsheet says.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              That's why I do this. I remember what it felt like to not believe in myself, to miss opportunities, to feel stuck. Now I get to spend my days showing people they have more options, more freedom, and more possibilities than they realized.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#031931] mt-10 mb-6">Let's Talk</h3>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you value expert advice, clear communication, and a genuine partnership in planning your retirement, I'd love to hear from you.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Whether you're 35 and just starting to think seriously about retirement, 50 and trying to figure out if early retirement is possible, or 62 and optimizing your CPP and OAS strategy, I can help.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              No sales pitch. No pressure. Just an honest conversation about where you are, where you want to go, and how we can get you there.
            </p>
